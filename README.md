# Lab Auditing App
This is a web-based application that was built in order to digitalize the documantation process of laboratory tests, by generating QR codes and keeping track of the user activities.

The original application also involves a mobile application that can scan the generated QR codes in order to record tests.
I built the React-based front-end of the web application as well as the entire back-end of the system in NodeJS and Express, including token-based authentication.
The application was originally deployed on MS Azure.
